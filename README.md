# 🖨️ ft_printf – Recreating printf in C

> 🚀 A core 42 project focused on mastering variadic functions, formatted output, and low-level data manipulation in C.  
> 🛠️ This project challenges you to reimplement the legendary `printf` function from scratch.

---

## 📌 Project Description

`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the standard C `printf` function.  
It aims to provide the same output behavior for a limited set of format specifiers without using standard library formatting tools.

You'll build a powerful function that handles **variable argument lists**, string formatting, number printing, and more — using only basic allowed functions like `write()` and `malloc()`.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to use variadic functions (`va_start`, `va_arg`, etc.)
- Formatted string processing and parsing
- Type-based output handling (chars, strings, numbers, pointers)
- Working within memory constraints and Norme rules
- Building a minimal printf engine from the ground up
- Creating a static library (`libftprintf.a`)

---

## 🧾 Supported Format Specifiers

Your `ft_printf()` function must support:

| Specifier | Meaning                                |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `%c`      | Print a single character               |
| `%s`      | Print a string                         |
| `%p`      | Print a pointer address (hex format)   |
| `%d`      | Print a signed decimal integer         |
| `%i`      | Print a signed decimal integer         |
| `%u`      | Print an unsigned decimal integer      |
| `%x`      | Print a lowercase hexadecimal number   |
| `%X`      | Print an uppercase hexadecimal number  |
| `%%`      | Print a literal percent symbol `%`     |

## 🛠️ Function Prototype

```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
```

- Takes a format string and a variable number of arguments.
- Returns the total number of characters printed.

---

## 🔧 Allowed Functions

- `write`
- `malloc`
- `free`
- Variadic macros: `va_start`, `va_arg`, `va_copy`, `va_end`

## 📁 Project Structure

```txt
ft_printf/
├── ft_printf.c         # Main logic for parsing and dispatch
├── ft_putchar.c        # Output a single character
├── ft_putstr.c         # Output a string
├── ft_putnbr.c         # Output numbers (int, unsigned, hex)
├── ft_utils.c          # Helper functions (lengths, converters, etc.)
├── ft_printf.h         # Header file with prototypes and includes
├── Makefile            # Compiles the library libftprintf.a
└── libftprintf.a       # The static library output
```

---

## 📄 Makefile Rules

Your Makefile must include the following:

- `all` – Build the static library
- `clean` – Remove object files
- `fclean` – Remove object files and the library
- `re` – Clean and rebuild
- `$(NAME)` – Target to build `libftprintf.a`

Compile with:

```bash
make
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

While testing is not part of the evaluation, it is **highly recommended**.  
Here are some simple examples:

```c
ft_printf("Hello %s, number: %d\n", "world", 42);
ft_printf("Pointer: %p\n", ptr);
ft_printf("Hex: %x / %X\n", 255, 255);
```

Compare your output with the original `printf()` and test edge cases.  
Use `valgrind` to ensure no memory leaks!

---

## ✅ Requirements

- ❌ No usage of standard `printf` or other formatting libraries
- ✅ Follow the 42 Norme
- ✅ Must compile with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
- ✅ Memory leaks are forbidden
- ❌ No global variables
